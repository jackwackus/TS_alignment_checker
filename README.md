# TS_alignment_checker

The ts_alignment_functions.R library is designed to aid in timestamp alignment quality control. The library contains seven function with two functions of principle importance. The find.common.peaks() function generates a table of all of the common peaks found across the specified parameters in the dataset. The plot.time.bounded.stacked.subplots() function allows the user to visually inspect for alignment the peaks detected by the aforementioned function.

The tool_tester.R script provides some example code for using these functions.
